A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emissions reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.
